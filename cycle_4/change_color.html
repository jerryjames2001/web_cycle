        <p id="bg">Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat, the air we breathe,
            <br> water we irrigate our crops with. We also rely on them for numerous other goods and services we depend on for our health, happiness and prosperity.<br>
             natural assets are often called the world's 'natural capital'.</p>
